<u><i>cup and ball</i></u>

i was a little shocked
when you left me
when i needed you the most.

i forced the door open.
i let myself through.
i beat you into place,
painfully complying.

we're back together
after far too long.
i don't know if it's the blood above your head
or the cracks in your body
but it seems like you're not really here with me.
