<a class="omori-game">
i'm going home

<a class="omori-game">
and i'll die trying

<a class="omori-game">
at least i'm hoping so, knife in the right hand
trying me, i'll take you down, even if it's both of us
something's wrong, something's deeply wrong, i feel it
getting cold in my hands as my fingers freezing
this city smells and i hate it deeply, watch me spiral
</a>
<a class="omori-game2">
DOWNWARDS RAPID ARMS ARE GETTING HEAVY IM STRUGGLING TO BREATHE
GOD IS WATCHING THERE IS NO DANGER BUT THAT INSIDE OF ME
