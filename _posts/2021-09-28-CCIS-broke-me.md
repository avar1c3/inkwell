*Note: this entry was written while I was in the psych ward. This was day 5, I believe. I had just been told that I would be sent to a residential program for 3 months.*

**CCIS BROKE ME.**

Anger:

Happy? You want me to be happy? I'll be FUCKING ECSTATIC! When did I become nothing more than a liability to you?

Depression:

The next 3 months of will be hellish. You will suffer as you lose the few scraps of freedom you have. Enjoy dropping out to MTHS, dipshit. This is what you get for not OD'ing.

Acceptance:

You are a junkie. An addict. A liability. No matter what you say or do, that will not change. Your choices don't matter. Don't you get it already?

I talked to [staff member] about how this experience will be painful, but I will grow as a person because of it.
