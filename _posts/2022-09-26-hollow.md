title: "hollow"
---

alone. scared. huddled under the desk, shifting restlessly.

there is something in your hand. it's calling you.

tired. numb. your head touches the corners as you clamor for retreat.

you put it to your skin. the inside opens itself up.

shocked. rushing. the red void starts to spread.

there looks to be nothing inside. are you hollow?
