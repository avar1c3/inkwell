title: 'lies i know to be true'
---

my parents are not willing to admit they're disappointed in me

they stopped expecting things of me because i continued to fail them

my father will always think of me as a boy

my friends are not willing to admit they don't like me

i'm either silent or saying things that make everyone uncomfortable

everyone has to deal with my name change and pronouns

i will never look acceptable

i am so lazy that i don't make any efforts whatsoever to look better

i've become complacent in my ugliness, accepting that i will always look like a lazy man pretending to be a girl

i am a drug addict

without amphetamine i'm a useless miserable cunt

without cannabis i'm a suicidal recluse

i'm chasing an enlightenment that doesn't exist

i am morally bankrupt

i am willing to traumatize my friends and family for my own selfish death wish

i lie and hide my drug use

i manipulate others to make them comfort me, knowing that they suffer for no good reason as i will inevitably get worse when they leave

i deserve none of the people i've unloaded all my problems onto

i deserve none of the material posessions i greedily hoard

i deserve none of the attention i whore and sadfish for

i gave up

i'm desperate

i love you

don't call the police
