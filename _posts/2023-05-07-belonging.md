i don't belong here, getting your hopes up<br>
always underperforming, never doing enough, settling my languid body down on the precipice of giving up.<br>
i never tried hard enough. i never committed myself completely. i took all i could from everyone else to make all but naught.

i don't belong here, taking up space in your field of view<br>
i gave him PTSD and now i can't even talk to him, refusing the basic necessities of a human relationship.<br>
to her, i am an eyesore, a moving obstacle, a bollard made of flesh that she despises to even have within her range.

i don't belong here, vomiting up my guts in someone else's toilet<br>
i wish i was sober. i wish i was a better person, not fucking my brain into a slurry with a reckless combination of half-hearted overdoses. i wish i didn't wake up the next morning, breathing gone still, choked on my own vomit.

i don't belong here, selfishly taking everything from you in both life and death.<br>
i still think about that extension cord. it's unlikely that would've gone to plan in the first place. i could buy rope now and nobody would know—but it's a moot point. if you want so desperately to be selfish for the last time, then do it; at the very least, the grief brings an end. don't keep taking everything from them indefinitely—just take yourself away from them already.
