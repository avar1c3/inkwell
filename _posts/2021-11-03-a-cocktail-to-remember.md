*"Fix me a drink, bartender."*

There's a cocktail I love more than any other. This one is near and dear to me, on a level few could understand.

Take one scalpel. Reusable, disposable, whichever is fine. The choice of blade is up to you; I'm personally going with a #10 disposable scalpel.

Now take it, and cut the flesh on your arms. The savory note of iron really adds something to the cocktail. 2-3 cuts on each arm, or 2 cuts on each leg should do it. Get that symmetry right! Presentation is important.

Once you've shed your blood, next you must shed your mind. Start with some DMT. I'm going to go with vaporized DMT, but you can use which ever form works best for you. Now, hit that shit as hard as humanely possible. You will start to feel intensification of every sensation and a beautiful delirium of sorts.

And there you have it!

Oh?

Who ever said it had to be a drink?
