i should have just killed myself

i give them their daughter back and *this* is the thanks i get?

everyone's lives would be easier if i didn't pussy out

i'm fucking sick of this shit

they took everything that mattered to me

this is my reward for choosing to live

doesn't seem like such a rewarding choice anymore

i contemplate doing it now but it's too little, too late

everything just makes me feel worse all the time

i feel like a failure 24/7 because of my living situation

i'm so sick of everything

i can't write for shit. i keep making mistkaes FUCK
