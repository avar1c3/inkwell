woke up with no hope today, remembered that i'm broke today
off 60 of the vyvanse, we trapping out the Tor today
beer for breakfast, cut me off the downers - i don't even need em
downer mental i'm too stuck on nothing to go see the future
she smoke me like it's charity, "remember, you're worth less than me"
need to face a one point five and still not got enough in me
DPH or percies, don't give a fuck, just give em to me
not enough that's in this scrip to free me from this slavery

BALL SO HARD THEY CALL ME ALONSO
NOTHING IN ME SO I DON'T GO SLOW
PUT 180 ON THE FUCKING SPEEDO
YOU WON'T SEE ME HOME NO MORE
YOU WON'T SEE MY FACE NO MORE
MAYBE I'LL GET WHAT I WANTED
COOKING GLOCKS INSIDE THE BASEMENT
I REALISE NOW THAT I'M RETARDED
I REALISE NOW I CAN'T GET OFF IT
KEEP ME CHAINED AND FUCK MY JAW OUT
SPLATTER MY THOUGHTS ALL OVER THE BATHROOM
GET IN A TIGHT BIND WITH MY CEILING
I JUST CAN'T DO THIS SHIT NO MORE
I'M TIRED OF CONSTANTLY FEELING
