i think i'm losing it again.

i'm overeating and gaining fat fast.

i'm oversleeping and wasting time all the time.

i maniacally giggle as i plunge the tiny little blade i've hidden away into my skin. i get giddy with excitement as i watch blood seep from the little scratches i make. i am too pathetic to do much more. i cherish the sanguine flavours on my tongue. i start to wonder to myself if i am insane. i am.

i'm definitely losing it again.
