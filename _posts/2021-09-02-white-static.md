title: 'white static'
---

A black car pulls into a driveway. Out comes a boy who makes his way to the front steps of a grand house. At the front door, he sheds his shoes and retreats up the stairs to his room. He sets down his bag and shuts the door behind him.

A girl takes off a mask designed to keep her safe from the world. She is alone from the dangers outside, and accompanied by the evils indoors. Through the half-shuttered blinds, beams of evening sun land on an unmade bed. She lays atop it, neither asleep nor awake.

The boy juggling 3 jobs at once was gone. There is only a girl sitting idle, languishing.

On good days, her mind is filled with white static. Her mind is filled with nothing and her senses are saturated with noise. The days rarely tend to stay good for long. Soon, the white static is replaced by a black abyss. In the deafening silence, she hears clearly. The voice of a man who is not her, speaking for her. Speaking to her, sharing kind words of disgust and loathing. Every word hits her ears, striking in the core of her psyche.

The boy giggling at his boss's banter was nowhere to be heard. There is only a girl curled up in a ball, sobbing silently.

She wails into the void. The vacuum carries nothing but silence, to be heard by nobody. In the pitch black darkness, she sees vividly. Visions of blood cover her arms and hands. She stares directly into the soulless eyes of her hanging body. Bits of brain splatter all over her mind as a thick, pink mist leaves her skull. A silver knife's mirror finish contrasts sharply with the dull crimson seeping from her chest.

The boy panting through his mask no longer struggled to breathe. There is only a girl lying motionless, dead silent.
