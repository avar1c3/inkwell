laying awake at 4 in the morning<br>
as slides cycle through a projector<br>
stills showing gratuitous nudity<br>
they're a bit overexposed, but<br>
they can't shine as bright as **you**.<br>
your eyes barely open, your pupils wide<br>
calipers barely showing the digits<br>
the numbers didn't matter anyways<br>
white specks splatter my stomach<br>
little bits of **you** all over me.<br>
covering sins with the smell of peach<br>
the pearly white of shiny teeth<br>
blood vessels broken beneath the skin<br>
dented tissue leaves impressions of **you**.<br>
you offered me a spare toothbrush<br>
really, that was the least of my worries<br>
whisky smells a lot stronger than fluids<br>
saliva overrides my breath with tastes of **you**.

thank you
