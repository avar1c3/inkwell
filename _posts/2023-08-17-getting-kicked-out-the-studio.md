woke up with no hope today, remembered that i'm broke today<br>
off 60 of the vyvanse, we trapping out the Tor today<br>
beer for breakfast, cut me off the downers - i don't even need em<br>
downer mental i'm too stuck on nothing to go see the future<br>
she smoke me like it's charity, "remember, you're worth less than me"<br>
need to face a one point five and still not got enough in me<br>
DPH or percies, don't give a fuck, just give em to me<br>
not enough that's in this scrip to free me from this slavery<br>
<br>
BALL SO HARD THEY CALL ME ALONSO<br>
NOTHING IN ME SO I DON'T GO SLOW<br>
PUT 180 ON THE FUCKING SPEEDO<br>
YOU WON'T SEE ME HOME NO MORE<br>
YOU WON'T SEE MY FACE NO MORE<br>
MAYBE I'LL GET WHAT I WANTED<br>
COOKING GLOCKS INSIDE THE BASEMENT<br>
I REALISE NOW THAT I'M RETARDED<br>
I REALISE NOW I CAN'T GET OFF IT<br>
KEEP ME CHAINED AND FUCK MY JAW OUT<br>
SPLATTER MY THOUGHTS ALL OVER THE BATHROOM<br>
GET IN A TIGHT BIND WITH MY CEILING<br>
I JUST CAN'T DO THIS SHIT NO MORE<br>
I'M TIRED OF CONSTANTLY FEELING<br>
