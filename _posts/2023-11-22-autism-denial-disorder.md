title: "Autism Denial Disorder"
---

i don't want to be disabled. i don't want to grovel at the feet of some office jockey that i'm too depressed and inattentive to do anything correctly. to drop any class that has provided to be a modicum of effort. to accept that i really am this useless. to submit myself to a demoralising path to "outgrowing" my disability. yeah, you learn to cope with it over time. why am i paying you?

i don't want to pay you hundreds. it rubs me the wrong way when it feels like you're selling me on more help. i feel sold already. what am i gonna do, say no? she's right; my lack of proper committal is why i feel i have no hope. half-assing my own path to being a better person. compounding, it feels like i'll never get better if i don't believe in you. because you're always right. weed is cheaper than therapy, but a lobotomy is more cost-effective. my addled brain is dragging me along for one hell of a ride.

i don't want to be bipolar. maybe if you knew everything, you'd realise that i never stopped wanting to die - they just feed you the pills anyways. the less of the brain you use, the less worse it feels to be suicidal. i'm always foggy anyways, and hopping up on drugs gets me down and out on w/d'ing. "no ups, just downs," i told them. apparently i'm still cyclical anyways. i would've at least appreciated mania or euphoria, i want to feel like everything is as beautiful as they tell me it is. if you are right, then i don't want to subject myself to a future of thrashing myself against it.

i don't want to live.

i don't want to get better.

i just want it to be over with.
