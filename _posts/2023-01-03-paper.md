wake up. flop out. creation itself is a myth.

with the only blade left, you <a class="omori-game-red">CUT</a> but there's nothing there

you <a class="omori-game-red">CUT</a> but your skin don't give, you're empty outside as you are in

as you scrawl to death, tears run dry as you bawl to death, and all you can do is <a class="omori-game-red">CUT</a>

so scream, 'til you choke yourself, cry, 'til there's nothing left, and weep, for there is no help.

just  <a class="omori-game-red">CUT</a>.



<a class="omori-game">
You think it was with great hubris that you thought you could make something of myself. Figuratively. Literally. Nothing came out. No tears, no saliva, no blood. You felt as though creation was the only way out. You've never scribbled anything worthwhile in your goddamn life. You felt like paper; every cut you made, nought left the pages. You felt like paper; every cut you made begot only more papercuts. You felt like paper, ready to throw yourself in a fireplace, and go somewhere higher.

But you are not paper. You are a vacant sack of flesh. Fail as you have in life, you now fail in death. Happy, you miserable scum?
