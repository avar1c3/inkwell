I was puffing hard. And I kept puffing. And puffing. Until the very concept of vapour, lungs, or psychoactive drugs no longer occurred to me.<br>
And suddenly, none of those concepts occurred to me. I think it was the colours, which I can only describe as posterized, futuristic digital art. Or maybe it was the inability to suppress my mile-wide grin. Maybe it was the transfixion on the spot on the wall which was rapidly folding in and out of itself.<br>
I was very clearly out of it. I was hooked into delirium. I was *tapped in.* I can only describe the indescribable through metaphor. Bear with me a moment, this is about to make no sense.<br>
Picture the ego of an individual. It permanently lives in an isolated vacuum. One cannot feel the ego of another, as they are trapped within the mindâ€”a barrier that can be looked into but never breached. To connect egos would be impossible. However, the impossible can be simulated by taking the brain out of a normal set of experiences. This is where DMT comes in.<br>
<br>
Imagine the ego as a user of a single-user computer. This computer never knew the exchange of data between machines. It knew that other computers exist in theory, but it has zero manner of interface with anyone but itself.<br>
A network extension would allow this computer that has never known another machine to suddenly become a piece of a massive web of other machines. The death of loneliness.<br>
DMT serves as a network stack of sorts. It bridges paths in the brain that never cross in normal operation. It creates a new, arbitrarily modified, set of experiences. It enables the ego to escape the sense of perpetual isolation.<br>
It turns a single-user machine into one capable of multi-user connections. It grants access to a network of other users. The death of ego.<br>
