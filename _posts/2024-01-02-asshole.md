what a fucking asshole. just to say something like that, just to burn a friend trying their best. what were you thinking?

cyclically, you feel too much. cyclically, you feel alone. what a fool. to cry jealousy and isolate yourself from others.

jealous of that you never worked towards, jealous of that you don't deserve.

jealous of their real connection, jealous of that you'll never have.

for the normal man cannot mesh, and the insane man grates your gears.

on an arrogant island of indefinite mediocrity.

why bother living?
