i can't fucking do it anymore

little seems to go right these days, what does work out feels hollow

simple tasks of daily life feel empty, as do i

of the three people i live with, one hates me, one is unapproachable, the last gets pushed to wits' end trying to deal with my bullshit

a similar pattern to the friends i keep - they, too, have an inane amount of bullshit to contend with trying to be near me

my brain is fried and my stomach is sick

hell, can't even do human empathy right

i'm worth nothing in assets nor as a person

i want to give up

i can't fucking do it anymore
