title: "half empty"
---

most all days i wake up, i feel half empty. unsatiated. batteries charged halfway, with the cell degradation doing me no favours. a stomach filled halfway with 80 octane and the other with gastric acid.

maybe it's the drugs. the longer i spend sober, the emptier i feel. drugs raised my baseline needs for brain and body activity. or perhaps they filled the gap that defined my endlessly restless childhood.

maybe it's my brain. i feel unable to have a good conversation with myself. my inner voice feels like a bad friend, leading me down paths my mama warned me about. THC modulated how we speak, meeting in common ground without malice or want. amphetamines made the inner voice irrelevant, the fire sparked beneath my ass making me run endlessly without meaning or thought. benzodiazepines made the inner voice shut up, taking down both parasite and host simultaneously. psychedelics definitely did...*something*. and left without them, i have this cynical parasite tugging at my brain until the host is exhausted.

i want to be whole. i don't know what it means to be whole. i'm not sure anyone even can be entirely whole. but i feel that i'm emptier than my peers, and i'll continue to be hung up on that until i grow past it or get suffocated by it.

please kill me.
