<a class="omori-game">
today, i will not jump in front of the tracks.<br>
tomorrow, i don't know. the future is yet to be decided.<br>
but for today, just for today, i will not jump in front of the train car.<br>

<a class="omori-game">
today, i will not jump off the roof of GITC.<br>
tomorrow, perhaps some other way, i will kill myself.<br>
but tonight, just for tonight, i think i must rest.<br>

<a class="omori-game">
today, i will not swallow every pill i have.<br>
tomorrow, bottles in hand, i will pop every capsule and tablet until i go numb.<br>
but today, just for today, maybe a joint will suffice.<br>

<a class="omori-game">
today, i will not impale myself through the chest.<br>
tomorrow, i swear to god, i will let myself free of all the blood i can pump.<br>
but today, just for today, a cut on the wrist will have to do.<br>

<a class="omori-game">
today, i will
