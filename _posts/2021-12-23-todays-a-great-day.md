title: "today's a great day to kill yourself"

<u>let's face it.</u> you always knew you'd amount to little.

PowerTools never became anything.

LIGHTSIDERS was never more than a conversation topic.

Project RS was a task for minds much greater than you.

Tangerine was nothing but a daydream.

an artistic vision is nothing without original thought.

<u>let's face it.</u> you were always more attracted to the idea of creating things than you were to actually making anything.

your selfishness plagues your psyche.

your laziness defines your life.

you leech off of others and make them accessory to your self-destruction.

you are pathetic.

<u>let's face it.</u> you should just give up already.

put down the pen.

stop struggling.

give into your heavy eyelids.

let the blood flow.

kick the chair.

today's a great day to kill yourself.
