Sub-microscopic. Imperceptibly small. And yet its impacts are massive. Psyche-shattering, world-shaking levels of massive.

It self-replicates, first throughout the pockets of one's mind, and soon to the hands of another.

We are ill. We are addled. We are defective by choice.

We propagate our illness to others. Through their lungs, their mouths, any mucus membrane willing to host us.

We are viruses, infecting the mind and breaking it, until it explodes.

And we are propagated again.
