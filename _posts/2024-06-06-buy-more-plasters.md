god i'm on so many drugs i don't know what i'm like sober anymore

trippin on a light dose of shrooms and i genuinely felt something for once in a long time

i cried. proper cried. stared at my hands. they were covered in ink.

ink stains my wrists under the white bandage wrap

ink stains the plasters on your arms poorly covering "secrets" 

ink stains your shirt like you don't even give enough of a fuck to change it

tears stain her face. she's crying that she loves you. you whisper back to her.

<a class="omori-game">
i love you too mum
</a>

you tell her to buy more plasters. she keeps crying

<a class="omori-game2">
please, let me look. let me take care of you.
</a>

but you cry, in between sobs managing

<a class="omori-game">
i'll do fine mum, just get some more plasters.
</a>

and now you sit in your room with a scalpel in your hand, asking yourself

<a class="omori-game">
why am i so selfish?
</a>

<a class="omori-game-red">
as i cut myself again.
</a>
