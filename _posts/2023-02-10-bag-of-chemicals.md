suspended<br>
between the bedframe and slumber eternal<br>
hunger eats at your stomach, never truly satiated<br>
your pains have finally left you<br>
and so have your faculties of mind<br>
<br>
engaged<br>
in an endless race against whatever comes across your desk next<br>
the acid cries in famine, the brain seems not to care<br>
you can finally get to work<br>
and absolutely nothing else<br>
<br>
entranced<br>
in a world other than your own<br>
you finally are full, overflowing in bounds<br>
for you are one, and all is you<br>
until the white light blinks in submission<br>
<br>
you are a bag of chemicals
