title: "i'm going insane again"
---

I am going insane again. Lots of urges: drugs, self harm, suicide, etc. are all on my mind. I've been thinking about going to the hospital. I don't want to go back. I am going to do what I can to make sure that I don't end up back there. I keep telling myself it's all temporary. I hope I'm right.

Today, I imagined something that wasn't there. The yellow eye in my hand was stabbed with a box knife, and it was seeping blood. Blood dripped from my wrists and the eye in my palm to my fingertips. I don't know what this means, and I doubt it means anything.

I wonder if anyone reads these. Why do you read these?
