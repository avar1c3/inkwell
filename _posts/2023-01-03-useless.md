when i finally woke up in my bed, my first question was how i teleported from the couch.

her first question was which i was reacting to: her finding out i failed two classes, or that she found me blacked out on the couch?



i should've known to stay away from Xanax. yet through my utterly retarded view, i wished for a fleeting moment of diability. after ringing in a new year with a banger of a party, i was so tempted to face temporary death that i immediately smashed 4mg of alprazolam and washed it down with my prize cognac.

what a gluttonous piece of shit i was.

what a gluttonous piece of shit i am.

now it's all gone. my precious DMT. my beloved Remy Martin. my 8 remaining bars of bitter bliss. the articles were expensive. i was pissed, in both senses of the word.



but $155 can be replaced. the real issue?

i am now alone in my own home. again.

and it's all my fault. again.

i deserve it all. again.

i've proven how useless i am. again.



she continued to yell at me more. i may have been jolted awake, but i was not conscious. i blacked out again, and dreamed an intense dream of surreal hospitalisation. is this what they call irony?

i've done nothing all day. set up servers here, watch some YouTube vids there, eat a granola bar, nothing useful. i can't think of anything but regret nor shame.

for i have proven myself utterly useless.
