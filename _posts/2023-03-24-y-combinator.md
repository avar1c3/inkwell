*Pain begets pain. It feeds into itself. It returns an endless chain of itself.*


I hate myself for all my laziness. I achieve nothing on time, nothing at all, nothing that lasts.<br>
I hate myself for my gluttony. I fill my mouth until my stomach fights back. I smoke some more and get back to gobbling.<br>
I hate myself for my cowardice. E-mails unread, lies not kept, projects not submitted.<br>
I hate myself for being pathetic. I cry and cry to an emotionless audience of Kleenex. I cry about nothing, I cry about everything.<br>


*Pain is recursive. It takes one form, and feeds into a function of neverending repitition. Each invocation chains on another invocation.*


I need to stop smoking.<br>
I need to take my pills.<br>
I need to go to classes.<br>
I need to do my assignments.<br>
I need to talk to the professors.<br>
I need to eat more.<br>
I need to talk to the advisors.<br>
I need to go to the gym.<br>
I need to go to physical therapy.<br>
I need to stop feeling bad for myself.<br>
I need to stop wasting my time.<br>
I need to stop wasting others' time.<br>
I need to stop catastrophising.<br>
I need to stop pitying myself.<br>
I need to stop being neurotic.<br>
I need to eat less.<br>
I need to sleep less.<br>
I need to talk less.<br>
I need to stop feeling.<br>
I need to stop breathing.<br>
