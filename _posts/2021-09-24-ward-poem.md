*Note: this poem was written while I was in the psych ward. This was from Day 1 of hospitalization.*

i dropped me a tab
i'm dropping the drugs
cleaned up my act, now i'm tossing my stuff

my hopes and my dreams
turned to a monster, turned to a fiend
empty inside, i done run out of steam

there's holes in my mind
running away from the demons inside
pain in my heart, need to swallow my pride

my father is yelling, my mama be worried
my piss testing dirty, these drugs gonna hurt me
the drugs gonna kill me, i gotta get sober
the lying is done, the running is over

so flush all the drugs and cut off that rope
CCIS, you're my only hope
