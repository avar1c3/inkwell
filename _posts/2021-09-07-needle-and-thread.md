title: 'needle & thread'
---

My mind is often empty. I'm always trying to fill it up. That's my theory as to why I'm always consuming something or doing something. I'm always clamoring for some engagement or excitement to pass my time. Boring tasks like laundry sit untouched for weeks while I'm beaming in new media to my brain. It causes me to get oversaturated with content, increasing my tolerance. Earbuds become something of an umbilical cord, drip-feeding me more content to keep my mind occupied. When my mental state gets worse, so does my addiction. I always love a good game that gets you entirely caught up in the experience, but when things get bad, that escape becomes a necessity.

Sewing, from the outset, is a pretty simple task. It gets complex when the designs become more intricate and the stitches become more involved, but at its core, it is not terribly difficult. A needle punctures through fabric, carrying with it a thread. With enough punctures, this thread becomes a stitch. Stitch together enough fabric, and they all combine to make a part&mdash;whether it be a garment, bag, costume, or more. The needle continues to weave through the fabric. The fabrics come together at the needle's edge.

*Under, through, and over. Under, through, and over.*

If I keep it up for long enough, I start to become one with the needle. The only thing on my mind is where I'm coming through next, and how much thread I have left.

*Under, through, and over. Under, through, and over.*

I have never enjoyed silence much. I always try to fill it with something, external or internal. But when I sew, I get lost in the process. I don't need anything else to fill the space. I can just sew. It's Zen-like.

*Under, through, and over. Under, through, and over.*

The stresses of life are gone for a moment. I no longer dwell upon my own unpleasantness. I have a moment of respite from the stress of college starting tomorrow. It's very peaceful.

*2cm left. Tie it off here.*

I think I'm getting better at stopping in time. I usually tie it off much too late and struggle to work with the little bit of thread I left myself. I loop through the same hole a couple times and snip off the remainder.

*Should I thread my needle and start again?

I have things I'm supposed to be doing right now instead.*

The reality of my current situation sets in again. I have to gather an assortment of information and supplies for school. I need to work on [REDACTED] while I still have time. I have gotten nothing done for that project whatsoever, and this is the last month to do anything. I have laundry that I need to run. I need to...

I've been wondering if I'll have time for simple tasks like this in the near future. I've accepted that school is pretty much taking over all of my time from herein, but I still hold out a little hope. Hope that I will have these peaceful moments still, even if only for a brief moment. I should do positive tasks, like sewing, more often. While I still can.
