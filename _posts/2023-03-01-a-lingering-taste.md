title: "a lingering taste"
---

Everywhere you look around you, there is a lingering taste of trauma. Under your cold blankets, there is a reminder that nothing will be okay again. On your lukewarm pillowcases, there is a reminder that snot is hard to clean out of bed linens. Speckling your warm sheets, there is a reminder that blood is even harder to clean.

Every time you look down, you feel the need to vomit. The drugs have far worn off; you feel poisoned nonetheless. Every time you glance at someone else, you feel like a stranger. You don't blame them; it was your incredible fuckups that made them hate you (deservedly).

And so you keep typing. For an audience of nobody. Because to do anything else would force you to look at yourself. Look at what you've made of the places around you. Look at what you've done to the people around you.

And so you keep scrolling. For an enternity of meaninglessness. Because to do anything else would force you to cry. Cry a river of tears for no one. Cry a river of tears that drown no sorrow.
