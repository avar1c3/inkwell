title: 'red and yellow'

with one working arm, a half-closed jacket, and a quarter of a brain, you stumbled.<br>
the grass was practically indistinguishable from the sidewalk. your head was practically indistinguishable from your feet.<br>
you stumbled into the honors dorms, passing out on the toilet.<br>
you stumbled into your friends, talking to campus security.<br>
you stumbled to your room, passing out on the bed.<br>
you stumbled in pain, talking to god.<br>

you received no response.<br>
you spat back in red and yellow.<br>
you screamed in pain and guilt.<br>
you received no response.<br>

your jacket was left behind. so were the contents of your stomach.<br>
what would she say if that happened?<br>
your memory was left behind. so were the contents of your pockets.<br>
what would you tell her happened?<br>

<a class="omori-game">drenched in gluttony</a><br>
<a class="omori-game">coated in lies</a><br>
<a class="omori-game">you disgust me</a><br>
<a class="omori-game-red">are you having fun?</a>
