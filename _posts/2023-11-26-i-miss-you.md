I miss you so much, Nico. More than you can ever know. More than I'll ever tell you.<br>
I'm happy to meet you, Sloane. You seem so much happier. You seem a lot brighter. You seem much more complete.<br>
What you said started to bother me. Not because you're wrong, but because I can't bear to wonder if I am. I've spent so much of my teenage years trying to accept a new me, despite the rejection syndrome. If it was all in vain, I'm not sure I could ever forgive myself. I don't ever want to think of myself as who I was. I know that we have different paths in life, and we need different answers to our own unique questions.<br>
And you say you're there for me. I know you are. I don't want to sound ungrateful; I really do appreciate it. But I've made this mistake already. Because when I do tell you, you'll never look at me the same again.<br>
It feels like everyone I have loved, everyone close to me, forgets me or actively choses to leave me. Honestly, I'm happy for them.<br>
I loved you like a brother, Nico.<br>
*I'm just waiting for you to follow suit.*
