# CODENAME TANQUERAY

I'm just ripping off Omori & Undertale then adding drugs to it for fucks sake I wish I would just have an original idea for once

## Plot

- You fight different versions of yourself, each with their own levels, boss fights, and worlds leading up to them. Ideas for the different versions:
	- Seven versions each embodying a different sin
	- One depressive & manipulative, one confident & demeaning, one unhinged & violent, one entirely apathetic
- You navigate through different worlds that represent different parts of your mind, each with their own colour palettes, music, enemies
- You perform actions which snap you back into reality
	- Events which summon strong memories/powerful recollections
	- Events which are psychologically jarring
	- Potentially actions where you hurt yourself/kill yourself
- Periods spent in reality flesh out the real-world meaning of the interactions you had with the imaginary/drug-world characters
- Certain drugs that take you into/out of worlds

## Mechanics

- Turn based RPG with encounters and bosses
- "Terminal-like" event logs in each battle
- Psychological effects & emotions that modify battles/overworld interactions
	- Drugs that affect psychological state and/or have battle effects
	- Attack types that have different effects for different moods/states of mind
	- Physical pain != damage, feeling or incurring physical pain can be used to your advantage or disadvantage
- Branching decision paths
- Scrolling damage

## Cast

You command a party of four. You can name each character, with each having a pre-filled name you can replace (except MC, whose is blank by default)
- Protagonist ("MC")
  Description:
  - Androgynous & generic, with a blank white tee and gray sweatpants. Light, slightly tan skin tone with dark brown eyes & medium-length black hair.
  - Young, around high-school or so
  - No default personality. Designed to be a blank canvas for the player to shape with their choices.
  Ideas:
  - When dealt a fatal blow, MC can survive with 1 HP. [screen blinks, "You refused to die." ECG pulse] Happens a max of 3 times per battle. [screen blacks out, "But death is inevitable." flatline tone]
  - MC can wield two-handed sharp melee weapons.
  Notes:
  - Use a gender neutral pronoun when referring to MC
  - Avoid using direct or implied quotes from MC. Instead of giving response options, give action options. This allows the player to more attach themselves to MC by inferring the dialogue in the way they see fit.
- Alex [name undetermined]
  Description:
  - Slightly older than MC. Medium muscular build, approx. 5'10". White buttoned shirt with a black tie and black pants. White skin with a slight tone & short blonde hair. Green eyes.
  - Very energetic and bold. Arrogant & quick to anger. Sharp-witted & cynical. Prideful and self-centred.
  - Has done a plethora of drugs. Could potentially be the intro story.
  Ideas:
  - You first meet Alex when you find him completely passed out next to an open bottle of B707s. He has no idea where he is, how he got there, or why he's wearing a tie.
  - When you see a new drug, Alex can explain it to you. He serves as the intro to the explanation, which you collect as you encounter different drugs and can access later.
  - Alex's weapon of choice is a pistol. Throughout the game, you encounter a variety of different pistols you can equip Alex with.
- Claire [name undetermined]
  Description: 
  - Young girl (same age as MC) with a cute & colourful appearance. Tan skin tone with hazel eyes & shoulder-length brown hair. Wears a short, light green dress with a flower in her hair.
  - Shy and reserved, but kind and caring. Empathetic and generous.
  - Claire can wield blunt melee weapons.
