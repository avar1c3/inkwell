**wheezing.** lungs that never quite fill. a throat lined with sawdust. a voice that croaks two octaves too deep. a cry that's painfully shrill.

**itching.** a skin that's cold to the touch. two shades closer to a cornflower's petals. this blanket's too warm, the room is too chilly. nothing's enough, and everything is too much.

**aching.** my shoulder's killing me again. my limbs tremor with a magnitude of 7. my spine aches all the same. my hair's gone in my mouth again, how many fucking times have i banged my fucking head?

**crying.** cause everything's fucked. overdue forms to the dean, classes absent for over a week. two projects torn away from my grasp. a longingly empty sense of touch.


afflicted i have become, in my bed i writhe in pain.

infected are my lungs, overheated is my brain.

my life comes apart again, the calls never come nor end.

and relegated alone in a room; has anything really changed?
