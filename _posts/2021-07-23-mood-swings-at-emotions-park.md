### My thoughts are becoming increasingly violent.

For the past few days, thoughts of murder, self-mutilation, and suicide have run amok. I'm having one of those moments where I realise I'm insane: I stop being so friendly, a scowl paints my ugly mug, and I mutter to myself all sorts of things. When I'm not playing my damn video games or scraping glue out of a Chromebook, I'm constantly running through my head methods of killing myself and violently gesturing at nothing. When I close my eyes, I see my wrists covered in blood. I don't have the requisite tools yet, but I yearn to make myself bleed. I think of stabbing myself right in the heart with a military knife, the jagged cutouts of the blade seeping into flesh and tearing whatever crosses its path. I taste the slide on my tongue, the muzzle on my palate, and the 107-grain jacketed hollow point nine millimetre defensive load tearing through the white and grey matters of my mind. I could buy enough fentanyl to kill me 250 times over&mdash;and I just might if I had the guts to do so.

### I want to blame the video games, but *the dialogue boxes were within me the whole time.*

I'll admit it: as stupid as it sounds, Deltarune gave me the idea of ripping my physical heart out. Omori gave me the idea of plunging a blade into my chest and keeling over. Uhh...I'm at a loss for the last two. Truth be told, those ideas were already floating in my head beforehand&mdash;I don't think I can blame those darned video games for this one. Whether my fingers are pressing the 'Z' key or pressing onto my temples, it's all the same in my head. Self-harm rears its ugly head again. While the content I consume may paint them bright new colours, I still cannot escape those thoughts lingering within me.

### *Don't worry about me, I'm fine.*

*Delusions of heroism.*

I should explain. When my mother came home from the hospital today, she told me what my sister was saying to her as she was strapped to her hospital bed. In a state of delirium, she yelled at me to "get in! Get in now!" Not sure where she thought she was, but she needed me there. "Get in here! I'll help you, I have a fight potion! Don't you ever do that to me again! Don't leave me! I need to save you! I am going to save you!"

I know she means none of it really, she's in a delirious fantasy world cause by a mix of psychosis, mania, and intoxication. They have her on a cocktail of painkillers and psychiatric meds that make her about as nonsensical as a retarded monkey hitting a typewriter. But I think that comes from somewhere deep within her; she feels a need to save me. Surrounded by the dangers of myself, I need to be saved&mdash;not just by her, but by everyone around me. I'm sure it comes as a shock to absolutely nobody that I'm not terribly fond of being saved. Every day, I try to cut the restraints on my exremities, free the carabiners on my harness, open the pressure lock valves on my spacesuit. I'm trying to break free of myself&mdash;no matter what it takes. But fret not casual reader, I have a long way to go until I've got the seal open. Please give me some time at least before calling the police on me Jackie. I don't like the feeling of going into the psych ER in one piece. ;)

### That's all, now go home.
