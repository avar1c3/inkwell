title: 'moody teenagers'
---

i am a moody teenager. i am just angry at my parents because i am a moody teenager. there is nothing wrong with me. i am just oppositional and petty because i am a moody teenager. my thoughts and feelings are irrelevant. they are irrational and meaningless because i am fickle and childish. my reservations, my anger, and my disconnection are just me being angsty and defiant. my thoughts do not matter. my feelings do not matter. they are all the products of hormonal imbalance and an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex.
