I'm tired of you pretending you care.<br>
I'm tired of you being nice to me when it's a good look for you.<br>
I'm tired of you only talking about me just to make fun of me.<br>
I'm tired of you talking over me.<br>
I'm tired of you dismissing me.<br>
I'm tired of you speaking for me.

I'm tired of being someone else.<br>
I'm tired of putting up with your "jokes".<br>
I'm tired of all the photos.<br>
I'm tired of your questions.<br>
I'm tired of pretending I care.<br>
I'm tired of all of you.
