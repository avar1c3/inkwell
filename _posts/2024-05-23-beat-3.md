i guess you got what you wanted<br>
i guess you got what you wanted<br>
i guess you got what you wanted<br>
i guess you got what you wanted<br>
i guess you got what you wanted

so medicated staring through you watch my eyes collapse<br>
sobbing softly in your bathroom pacing through the laps<br>
watching through as you cry i feel nothing at all<br>
going home stopped by lowes thinking of painting walls<br>
thinking of going home, thinking i'll go forever<br>
moving out of this head, forsaking cold shelter<br>
what do i even tell him, the muzzle's nice in the mouth<br>
spin the gun in my hand i never let you put to yours <br>
steel feels nice on the lips, trigger break's kinda shit<br>
piano drag through the sand, 6 pounds or thereabouts<br>
smile wide, open your mouth; i finally got what i wanted<br>
so many pills i can't think, my stomach takes up oration<br>
fingers smell like vomit, wrists itchy sensation<br>
crying into the toilet but nothing's coming out<br>
i love you so much i could leave you without<br>
without the one that you love, nobody's ever home<br>
empty windows cold shoulders just leave me alone<br>
im fine i promise i swear, im sober leave me upstairs<br>
theres nothing in my pockets, just go to bed<br>
i'm just a little chilly, just got a little busy<br>
i'm working towards what i wanted

i think i got what i wanted<br>
i think i got what i wanted<br>
i think i got what i wanted<br>
i think i got what i wanted
