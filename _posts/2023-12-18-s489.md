doubling up white & orange capsules<br>
pushing what your body can handle<br>
you rationalise, it's within range<br>
as you eye up an entire handful<br>
pop another for the sleep you skipped<br>
i could get addicted to this.<br>
this feeling of a focused nothing<br>
as you feel your heartbeat thumping<br>
functional, like all your peers<br>
rational, or so you try to appear<br>
behind sunken eyes and yellowed teeth<br>
there's no one behind this veneer

to act in incongruent ways<br>
through violent moods and rainy days<br>
cold, unfeeling, like a robot<br>
disappointment don't feel quite the same<br>
an ailing mind in empty bliss<br>
i could get addicted to this.<br>
this silence of a screaming mind<br>
in flow states that fast-forward time<br>
when i can't think, it hurts far less<br>
as i'm calmly contemplating death<br>
hope it kills me, preferably soon<br>
this living corpse has nothing left
