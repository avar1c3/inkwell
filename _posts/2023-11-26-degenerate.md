i find it so hard to reconcile my degenerate behaviour<br>
no matter what you tell me, i can't stop feeling insane<br>
being psychotic never felt so good, and i've never felt more guilty<br>
being slothful never felt so rewarding, and i've never felt more useless<br>
being apathetic never felt so comforting, and i've never felt more pain<br>
and so long as i never change, i'll always be ashamed<br>
and so long as i never clean up, i'll always be embarassed<br>
and so long as i never let go, i'll never tell you how bad it's gotten<br>
and so long as i never admit it, i'll never reconcile anything.
