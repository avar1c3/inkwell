fuck

i can't 

aaaAAAUGH

scream any louder youll wake them up<br>
go ahead bring them down see what i care<br>
ill eat their faces for breakfast<br>
continental breakfast need a midnight snack<br>
might just kill you right here and help myself<br>
high as fuck in this waking hell<br>
youre fading around as i fail to sleep<br>
close my eyes and pray, by god im weak<br>
and fuck you too, so get on your knees<br>
fuck me hard, fuck me deep, can't feel a thing<br>
fuck am i doing, why the fuck can't i see<br>
the fuck did i do to get stranded out in Albany<br>
my gluttony kills me and soon i'll kill you too<br>
you taste so good fresh from the slaughter<br>
i couldnt help myself, neither could the neighbours<br>
they scream so loud i could make them quiet<br>
i hate this place and the people and maybe you too<br>
i'm breaking out<br>
im breaking out<br>
ill break it out

your chest

collapse.
