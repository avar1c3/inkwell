*Note: this was written after discharge, during what I call the "lockdown" period: no possessions, no people, just languishing. This entry was written after a bad argument with my parents.*

this isn't real life. it's a nightmare. a bad trip. you wake up from dreams when you die in them. that works out fine, i don't have many reasons to live anyways. all these stupid restrictions are killing me. all i learned from that argument was that i'm an impatient failure who jeopardized my whole family's safety and that i should just kill myself when i get the chance. what a fucking joke of a life. my experiences don't matter and they never have. apparently 17 days don't matter when i should be in jail for 17 months. okay then, send me there! since you hate me so much anyways. i regret getting help. i should have just killed myself, and i would have had i known this is what help would be like. this is not help. this is making things worse. i'm so sick of everything. i told my parents i'd rather be dead.
