I don't know if anyone reads these. I doubt anyone does. If you do, text me some shitty non-sequiteur related to this blog and watch me puzzle in confusion.

I told most everyone I shared the link with not to share this with anyone. But now I realise: I've already shared it with so many people that it's basically a moot point to tell people to be hush-hush about it. I'm bad at keeping secrets, so why should I make you keep them instead?

I don't know *why* you'd ever want to share the retarded ramblings of a lunatic on a shitty Jekyll theme with anyone, but if you do, well, I now give you permission to do so. I'm making this decision because I doubt anyone is even reading this post, and if they are, they probably are going to do nothing with this new declaration.

**tl;dr:** I can't keep this place much of a secret, so why should I make you?
