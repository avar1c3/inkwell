title: "listless & endless"
---

i don't know why i'm here anymore. whatever reason i had before has completely left me, were it there to begin with.

Ishwar told me that the hamster wheel doesn't have to be a bad thing. as i keep waking up late, staring at the wheel and feeder, i ask myself if it could even be a good thing.

i keep waking up confused and listless. defeated before the battle even makes way. listless, and in need of Listerine. conceited. you gave up. this is your fault. you have the power to get up and get out there, and you languish.

covered in blood and guilt, it occurs to me: there are no directions.
