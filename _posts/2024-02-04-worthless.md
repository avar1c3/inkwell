title: 'worthless (to whom?)'

you'll always feel alone<br>
even with someone who loves you<br>
if you never love yourself.

writing your last status<br>
over again and again in your head<br>
as a preperatory exercise<br>
for announcing your departure.

like logging off<br>
from this game of life<br>
debts still outstanding<br>
but irrelevant at this point.

i'm thinking it all over<br>
knowing it'll hurt you<br>
and feeling guilty for ensnaring you.

maybe that's why<br>
every time you say you love me<br>
i shudder a little<br>
knowing that i love you too.
