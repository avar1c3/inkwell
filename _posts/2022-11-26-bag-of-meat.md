yesterday, i realised that i had been skipping my medications for 5 days. not out of any intention, rather the fact that i had become so lazy/forgetful/negligent/(all of the aforementioned) that i had simply lapsed in my need to comply.

today, i realised that i didn't feel a difference. i realised that i've actually been doing better since i stopped taking them. a fool would take that and say that they're useless and i should stop taking them. but in truth, i think this leads to a much more troubling conclusion: how much of my psychological well-being am i sabotaging? why do i keep taking medications of middling effect, regardless of the emotional numbness they provide me? how do i juggle addiction and staying afloat? my psychiatrist said that i shouldn't worry about dependency or withdrawal at prescribed dosage. i explicitly stated that i felt as though my longer-term use of amphetamine has left me more tired overall, and that i really felt down and scuffed when i stopped taking it. even below prescribed amount, i still find that my amphetamine use has a lasting effect on my overall well-being.

i constantly feel like a bag of drugs. i want to cut myself open and bleed myself sober
