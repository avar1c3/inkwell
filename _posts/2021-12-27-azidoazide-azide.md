I got a gram of fentanyl, this gon fuck some bitches up
Got a Durex in my pocket but never fucked no bitches up
Cause I'm an insider, suicide letter writer
Cut myself open, see what's inside here
Ain't a girl that would let me inside her
3D printed guns gonna commit violence
But never at you, I could never hurt you
So please forgive me for what I might do
Because I promise that I feel the pain too, man I miss you
These drugs is not a hobby, swear this shit is gonna harm me
Might be the end of me, fuck it, naloxone is for bitches
Pissing on the houseplants got my mama scared shitless
Man I'm tired

*couldn't be a pretty boy so i became an ugly girl*
