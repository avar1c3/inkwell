title: 'despair ad infinitum'
---

and *puff.*

what started as lightheadedness turned into weakness. you collapsed into a pile and fell into yourself. inside the cavernous infinite space of the mind, you saw the world eating itself. energies and colours folding into themselves. it was overwhelming. witnessing things beyond description, beyond understanding. 

and when reality returned, the confusion and overwhelming nature wrapped around you. you had unfinished business, stimuli left to process. you told yourself you must go back.

with headphones installed and ticket in hand, you punched your round-trip to insanity. a beautiful madness.

...but it wasn't so beautiful this time.


you witnessed the birth of a million souls. and you watched the death of every one, overcome by sympathy and sorrow. you were alone, watching the infinite cycle of death and rebirth.

you weren't ready to die. you weren't ready to be born again. this endless cycle of death and resurrection at the end of the world happened before you. and you cried, at the edge of a universe full of pain.

and you were no longer yourself. you were overtaken by a force you could not comprehend. a parasite only comparable to god itself. your eyes were opened. opened to a world of pain. you lost all faculties of mind as you were washed over by psychosis. the parasite had shown you the whole picture. your third eye was opened. and you wept from all three. you saw the end of the world and the death of the soul. you saw it all.


and i'm so sorry

that you finally understand

you can close your eyes

but you'll never be the same


but i will always be with you.
