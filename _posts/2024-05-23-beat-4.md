spark it / suck it again<br>
spark it / suck it again<br>
spark it / suck it again

coughing out my left lung, got right nose on the bleed<br>
lying down on the carpet coming off 60 speed<br>
i'm just waiting on feeling the 3,5 of weed<br>
i need something to fix me, i need something to fuck me<br>
i need something to make the void a little less empty<br>
so if it's your scrip that i'm popping, don't really give a fuck<br>
rivotril, ativans, remember what you told me bout it<br>
your therapist happy for you while i'm spiralin out it<br>
i can't get too comfortable, only 5 left in the strip<br>
ain't talked to mine in months, like you'd know what i need<br>
tell you what i need, tuck it, roll it, and light it<br>
with every thrust i feel nothing, i could do this all day<br>
your tears lubricate me, this feels so fucking great<br>
i feel so fucking happy, drown the silence with clapping<br>
who the fuck even are you, don't really care at this point<br>
need to stop by the florists, need to roll me a joint<br>
i need to get me a pounding, not the headache i mean<br>
i need to fuck me a stranger, love is killing me<br>
or the drugs i'm taking, or the gun in my mouth<br>
never made it to wyoming before i headed out<br>
it's not about what you wanted, it's about what you need<br>
popping pills out the blisters, joints roll in threes<br>
and that fix i've been running towards is killing me<br>
hole's been punched in my head, wait for my brain to bleed
