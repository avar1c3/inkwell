smashed three halves but there's another one calling me

half is nice but one is better, 1,25 sublingually

dose on my wrist i'm fucking embarrassed,

popped 150 dxm in front of your parents

blacking out in the bathroom, your excuses don't hold water

solid hours dissapear from sober minds in the bathtub

maybe it's better this way; i just wish you didn't see me

when i'm alone i'm tempted just to take enough to kill me

but when it's over i don't want to leave you with the body


are you disgusted yet

sobering up, do you trust you yet

when the drugs make you a better person

can the real you keep pace

i'm a fraction of the pills that pin me up

i'm a fraction of the person i wish i was

when i'm sober just kill me it's over

when it's over, please let it be over

when it's over; there's no true closure

"I'm not worried that the drugs will kill you. I'm just worried they're the only thing keeping you from killing yourself."<br>
And you're right. And I feel pathetic.<br>
When I stop showing up one day, I'm gonna miss you Alex.<br>
Because you're god damn right.
