title: 'Escaping Into Reality'
---

Welcome to WHITE SPACE. You have been living here as&mdash;

No. Cut it out.

I have been increasingly depressed lately. More thoughts of suicide and death, placated by pretty little distractions or pharmacological hugs (feel-good drugs). I realise now why I've been spending so much time playing video games when I have so much on my mind. I'm escaping a real world filled with hard thoughts I don't want to spend time with. While I neglect my laundry, my hair, my desk, my body, I numb the neuroses of my mind with an experience that can wholly absorb me.

Spoiler alert: Yes, I am going to talk about OMORI. Should I? Absolutely not, I think everyone around me is sick of hearing me ramble about it. But **inkwell** is not for everyone around me, it's for me, and as selfish as it sounds, I am going to write for me. *Ye poor souls who read this blog, tread with caution: thar be fangirls about!*

I realised that I don't get to choose reality. Well, at least I shouldn't be able to, and therefore I don't. Because I know what happens to those who reject reality. Look at Christian Weston Chandler. Is he happy? Is he living a good life, running from the bleak existence he inhabits? But I can temporarily get away from everything on my mind through the medium of video games. One particular game has obsessed me, a psychological-horror, top-down 2D RPG called OMORI. At its core, it is about escaping a painful reality. Sunny couldn't cope with what he did, so he repressed his traumas and tried to live a happy make-believe life in his head where all his friends were still there for him, where his sister was there for him, and where he wouldn't be there to ruin any of it. But as the dreamer gets more desparate, the dreams fall apart. You don't get to hide forever. Your deepest, most repressed thoughts will always come back to haunt you.

And yet, despite the game very obviously being about coping with reality and learning to overcome the things facing you, I escape into this world where everything was overcome. To be honest, OMORI does not have a happy ending. It has a good ending, a fulfilling ending, the best ending that it could have, but in the real world, the dead stay dead, and the scarred can only heal so far. But I got to pretend that I fought what I was running from, I overcame what I had repressed. I got to pretend that everything got better in the end.

Yet, I still haven't confronted anything. My laziness? Unchecked. My anxiety? Disregarded. Physical dysphoria? I haven't even made an effort. I keep repressing all thoughts of my face. In OMORI, I always look in the mirror to see the state I am in and confront the SOMETHING behind me. In real life, I look away at even the slightest glimpse of my own reflection. Even when it's almost entirely covered in hair, I can't stand to look at it. The only thing that makes it even tolerable is a face mask to cover up the face I spent years hiding from.

I kept escaping into a world where everything was better. I stopped worrying about my own issues and I became one with Sunny, overcoming reality and enjoying the beautiful dreams. While my brainrot-level fangirling isn't just because I'm running from my own problems, I can't deny that it's been a comfort&mdash;which is ironic, given how dark and depressing the game gets. *Don't fuck with us OMORI fans, we haven't stopped crying in months.* Despite the game actively showing the player the ruin of long-term repression and dreamlike escapism, I continue to escape. The real question is: when do I wake up?

Because by the time I open the menu and select <a class="omori-game-red">STAB</a>, it will be too late.
