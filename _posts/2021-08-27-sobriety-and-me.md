<a class="omori-game">*One more day, the sun reaches my bed, another day to spend alone again*<br>*Memories of the past, both the good and the bad, overwhelm me*</a>



Over the past week, I have been spending a lot more time inebriated. Bar the day that my friend was visiting, I was hitting carts & delta-8-THC disposables to escape what's inside: emptiness and despair. On Sunday, I got high with my friend who had come over to visit. On Monday, I said I would stay sober but my state got worse and worse and I turned to the drugs. On Tuesday, I said I would stay sober but ultimately failed that as well. On Wednesday, I was able to successfully stay sober the whole day. On Thursday, I was becoming increasingly more and more depressed, but I was able to keep myself mostly distracted with video games and shitposting. However, I was struggling to eat dinner that night, becoming incredibly anxious and withdrawn at the thought of eating with others, or even eating at all. My mother came to my room and started pleading with me to eat, telling me that my habits are making her suffer by forcing her to watch me starve myself. I felt incredibly disoriented, upset, and somewhat angry as a result. The simplest solution was just to eat dinner, but I was struggling to do even that. So I whisked myself away, snuck off to the bathroom with my disposable, and got high. Eating was still somewhat of a challenge, but I was able to eat at least half of my dinner before I started slowly picking away at it like I usually do. I felt guilty, not only for what my mother had told me, but for how I turned to drugs in a time of hardship like that. I still feel guilty.



Today is Friday. I have not done any drugs yet, but they have very much been on my mind. At this point, I'm not occassionally blotting out the bad thoughts, I'm full-on *running* from them. Before I even left my bed, I was already having thoughts of auto-mutilation and suicide. I can never satisfy them, what with being too weak to act upon any of these thoughts. For that reason, I try to run from them as much as I can. I told myself I was going to try again at staying sober, but I don't trust myself, and you shouldn't trust me either.



I wanted to do acid sometime this week, but my mental state has been deteriorating, and I think my struggles to keep sober plus my bad headspace would make psychedelics an awful choice.
