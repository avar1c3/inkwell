i want to stab him so much

i want to stab him so much



i am powerless against the man who traumatised me

today was a reminder of that

i want to stab him so much

i wish i stabbed him that day

maybe then he'd respect my fucking boundaries

i wish he would actually kill himself instead of just threatening to do it every time i confronted him on the bullshit living restrictions he imposed on me

i am helpless

the only person his equal would never do anything anyways

except maybe drag my disabled sister downstairs in an attempt to coax me out of the basement

i am so pathetic i couldn't even hold the door closed

i can do nothing

the only thing i can do is hurt myself to validate how pathetic and useless i feel

which is exactly what i'm going to do
